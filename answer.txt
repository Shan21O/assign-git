1. What is a gitignore file and what should it include for a Java project? 
   Gitignore files instructs users to ignore certain files. Temporary files and system files, such as.project and.class, are not posted to git. Package files and built class files should be included in java log files.

   It allows us to develop individually and eventually integrate without colliding.
